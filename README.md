# Advent-of-Code-2023
*my (probably) measely attempt at the 2023 advent of code*


Hello wearey traveller across the land of frontend source control management with a hint of effectively social media! This is my attempt at the AoC 2023 and my first AoC ever. I will attempt to do every challenge possible and commit hopefully daily as soon as I get an answer. Who knows? Maybe I will do this every year now on! Also I think all if not almost all of the programs in this year's AoC by me will be done in C++. 

## Navigation

All the challenges are spread into days and their respective parts. Here is a sample output of 'tree' on day 2.
```
❯ tree
.
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── Day 1
    │   ├── Part 1
    │   │   ├── input.txt
    │   │   └── Trebuchet?!.cpp
    │   └── Part 2
    │       ├── input.txt
    │       └── Trebuchet?!.cpp
    └── Day 2
        ├── Part 1
        │   ├── Cube Conundrum.cpp
        │   └── input.txt
        └── Part 2
            ├── Cube Conundrum.cpp
            └── input.txt

8 directories, 9 files
```

If I do this next year the navigation style will probably change, with a respective folder for 2023, and a new folder for 20XX.

To view this repository on your machine rather than relying on some goofy microsoft frontend:
`git clone https://github.com/jeebuscrossaint/Advent-of-Code-2023`

Thanks traveller, I hope you are well rested and informed about your journeys. :pray:
